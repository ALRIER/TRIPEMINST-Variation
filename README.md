# TRIPEMINST-Variation
 I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed specifically for a 3-digit recognition task, in this case a variation of the well-known Triple-MNIST dataset. Unlike a traditional single-digit classifier, this setup required the model to recognize sequences of digits simultaneously.

Note:
The folder named artifacts, which contains my network, has been split into multiple parts. Since I am unable to install Git on my companyâ€™s computer due to privacy restrictions, this was the only way to manage the files. If you need to work with it, please download all the parts and reassemble them on your own machine.
